## These functions are designed to help cache the inverse of a matrix,
## so that it's not necessary to run time-costly calculations every time
## this value is needed

##  This makeCacheMatrix function creates a special
## "matrix" object that can cache the inverse of an invertible matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve
        getinverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
        
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then 
## cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        
        i <- x$getinverse()
                if(!is.null(i)) {
                        message("getting cached data")
                        return(i)
                }
                data <- x$get()
                i <- solve(data, ...)
                x$setinverse(i)
                i
        }
}
